For enums with no data fields on any of the\nvariants, e.g. `enum Color {Red, Blue, Green}`, this effectively sets the size\nof the enum to the size of the provided type. Such an enum can be cast to a\nvalue of the same type as well. In short, `#[repr(u8)]` makes a field-less enum\nbehave like an integer with a constrained set of allowed values.\n\nFor a description of how `#[repr(C)]` and representations like `#[repr(u8)]`\naffect the layout of enums with data fields, see [RFC 2195][rfc2195].\n\nOnly field-less enums can be cast to numerical primitives. Representations like\n`#[repr(u8)]` will not apply to structs.\n\n`#[repr(packed)]` reduces padding to make the struct size smaller. The\nrepresentation of enums isn't strictly defined in Rust, and this attribute\nwon't work on enums.\n\n`#[repr(simd)]` will give a struct consisting of a homogeneous series of machine\ntypes (i.e., `u8`, `i32`, etc) a representation that permits vectorization via\nSIMD. This doesn't make much sense for enums since they don't consist of a\nsingle list of data.\n\n[rfc2195]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2195-really-tagged-unions.md\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/arch/aarch64/exception.rs","byte_start":1646,"byte_end":3740,"line_start":58,"line_end":133,"column_start":1,"column_end":2,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"unsafe extern \"C\" fn exception_vector_table() {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":48},{"text":"    core::arch::naked_asm!(","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":28},{"text":"        // ========================================","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":52},{"text":"        // Current EL with SP_EL0","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":34},{"text":"        // ========================================","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":52},{"text":"        ","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":9},{"text":"        // Synchronous -
